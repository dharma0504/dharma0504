<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Dharmatej Mallampati</h1>

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at SRMAP. I love turning ideas into reality through code — not just solving problems, but creating solutions that enhance everyday life. Curious by nature, I enjoy experimenting with new tools, learning by building, and working across the full stack — from intuitive frontend interfaces to robust backend systems. My focus lies in real-world applications and user-centered design, and I'm driven to contribute to projects that leave a lasting impact.
